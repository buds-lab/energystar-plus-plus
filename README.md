# EnergyStar++: Towards Fair and Explainable Building Energy Benchmarking System

The aim of this project is to develop the next generation building energy benchmarking system with following capabilities:

 - **Fair**: to ensure *fair* comparision of building's energy efficiency.
 - **Explainable**: to make the benchmarking process is understandable to the buliding owners. 
 
### [ENERGY STAR® for Buildings & Plants](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings)
ENERGY STAR® is the most widely used energy benchmarking system for buildings and plants in the USA. 

We reproduce the ENERGY STAR® models for the following building types:
 - [Hotels](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/hotel.md)
 - [K-12 Schools](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/k12school.md)
 - [Multifamily Houses](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/multifamily.md)
 - [Offices](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/office.md)
 - [Retail Stores and Supermarkets](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/retail.md)
 - [Warehouses](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/warehouse.md)
 - [Worship Facilities](https://github.com/buds-lab/EnergyStarPlusPlus/blob/master/CBECS/worship.md)
